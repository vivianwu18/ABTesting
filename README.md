# A/B Testing
A/B testing is a method of comparing two different versions of a web page, app, or other digital product to determine which one performs better. In A/B testing, two versions (version A and version B) are shown to different groups of users, and data is collected on how each version performs in terms of a specific goal, such as the number of clicks, sign-ups, or purchases.
